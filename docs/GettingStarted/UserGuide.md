Mind+ is a comprehensive creative platform that integrates visual programming with code programming, meeting users' complete workflow needs from basic learning to project development.
Whether you are a newcomer to programming or a creator looking to implement intelligent interactive applications, you can gradually improve your programming skills in Mind+ and complete creative project construction.

The platform is widely used in primary and secondary school programming education, maker teaching, STEAM courses, and artificial intelligence practice, helping users build systematic and progressive learning paths.

In Mind+, you can not only write programs but also conduct AI Model and create complete human-computer interactive works with View tools, achieving a complete development experience from creative conception to actual presentation.

Learning pathway reference:

| **Goal**                                                | **Recommended Starting Point**        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| I'm a beginner and want to understand programming first | Coding    |
| I know some programming and want to play with hardware or intelligent interaction | Coding + Model |
| I want to create a complete APP / project display interface | Coding + View |
| I want to train AI models like image recognition, image classification, or pose classification | Model |

To help you get started quickly, we have prepared guided navigation for three key functional modules. You can freely choose a path to start exploring based on your needs:

| **Functional Module**     | **What You Can Do**                                     | **Suitable For**                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Coding  | Use visual or code mode to write programs, control hardware, or build animations and games | Beginners / Advanced Creators |
| Model            | Train image/audio/text models to achieve intelligent recognition and interactive experiences | Maker Education / AI Creators |
| View          | Use UI design tools to create interactive interfaces, realize human-computer dialogue and application display | Project Developers / Display-oriented Work Creators |
